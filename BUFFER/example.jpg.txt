Libraries And Algorithm:

Tesseract OCR Library

This package contains an OCR engine - libtesseract and a command line program -
sesseract. Tesseract 4 adds a new neural net (LSTM) based OCR engine which is
focused on line recognition, but also still supports the legacy Tesseract OCR engine
of Tesseract 3 which works by recognizing character patterns. Compatibility with
Tesseract 3 is enabled by using the Legacy OCR Engine mode (--oem 0). It also
needs traineddata files which support the legacy engine, for example those from the

tessdata repository.

Tesseract has unicode (UTF-8) support, and can recognize more than 100
languages "out of the box".

Tesseract supports various output formats: plain text, hOCR (HTML), PDF,
invisible-text-only PDF, TSV. The master branch also has experimental support for

" ALTO (XML) output.

; You should note that in many cases, in order to get better OCR results, you'll need
_ to improve the quality of the image you are giving Tesseract.

| Tesseract can be trained to recognize other languages.

This library has its wrapper for python3 named as tesserocr

tesserocr integrates directly with Tesseract's C++ API using Cython which allows
for a simple Pythonic and easy-to-read source code. It enables real concurrent
“xecution when used with Python's threading module by releasing the GIL while
